				I love sharing mathematical ideas in a way that anyone can read and enjoy. Most recently, I wrote about polynomials for <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-find-structure-in-biased-polynomials-20211109/">Quanta Magazine</a> and about recent math news for <a href="https://mathvoices.ams.org/mathmedia/">AMS Math in the Media</a>.

			<p>
				I was a 2021 <a href="https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-fellowship/tamar-lichter-blanks">AAAS Mass Media Fellow</a> at <a href="https://theconversation.com/us">The Conversation US</a>, where I helped write and edit news articles about math and science. My fellowship was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.ams.org/programs/ams-fellowships/media-fellow/massmediafellow">American Mathematical Society</a>. A list of the pieces I worked on at The Conversation can be found on my <a href="https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-fellowship/tamar-lichter-blanks">AAAS page</a>.

				From 2014 to 2017, I wrote a "Math In Plain English" column at the Queens College publication <a href="http://qcvoices.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/author/tamarlichter/">QC Voices</a>.

    			I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.math.rutgers.edu/people/department-committees-and-service-activities#gsa">Graduate Student Liaison Committee</a>. The Liaison Committee meets with faculty about matters of concern to graduate students in the math department. We also help run the Graduate Open House for the math department every year.
